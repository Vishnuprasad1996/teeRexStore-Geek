Background
King Shan wants to start a t-shirt business, where he sells t-shirts online. To run his business, he needs a simple webapp where customers can browse through the catalog of t-shirts, add t-shirts to the shopping cart and checkout the items in the cart. 

Task
Your job is to build a simple UI, which allows a customer to do the following: 
    1. Browse the catalog on a product listing page
    2. Each card should have the image, name and price.
    3. Search using free text which is a combination of one or more of the below attributes
        ◦ Name 
        ◦ Colour 
        ◦ Type 
        ◦ Eg. green polo 
    4. Filter for t-shirts using specific attributes
        ◦ Gender 
        ◦ Colour 
        ◦ Price range 
        ◦ Type 
    5. Add one or more t-shirts to the shopping cart
    6. View the shopping cart by clicking the shopping cart icon
    7. Increase quantity or delete items from the shopping cart
    8. Display the total amount in the shopping cart.

Rules
    1. Every t-shirt type has a limited quantity. If the customer tries to order more than the available quantity, an error message should appear. 
    2. Filter can be applied by itself or on top of the search results. 
    3. Filters and Search need not be retained on navigation between pages, But the items in the cart should be retained. 
    4. The mockup provided is only a sample so that you have an indication of what is expected from you. You could choose to go with a completely different user experience. But you will need to ensure that all requirements mentioned in the problem are covered & there should be navigation between screens. 
    5. All features (search, filter, add to cart etc) should be handled on the client side. 
    6. There are no API's provided for these features. 
    7. There is no need to handle pagination. 
    8. There is no need to implement user registration / login.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
